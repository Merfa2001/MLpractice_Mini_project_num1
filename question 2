2 The second question
1. By referring to this link, get acquainted with a dataset related to the field of "banking" and while briefly explaining its goals and features,
Download the file and after uploading it to your Google Drive, put it in the Google Kolb environment with the gdown command
give If you need to change the format of this dataset file, do it with Python commands.
1. Mix the data and divide it into two with the desired and reasonable ratio
2. While explaining the importance of the process of pouring (mixing)
Divide the "training" and "evaluation" sections.
3. Code the model, loss function and learning and evaluation algorithm without using ready-made Python libraries to
The classes in the dataset are well separated from each other. Draw the graph of the loss function and evaluate the accuracy result
Calculate on the test data. Analyze the graph of the loss function. Can it be seen from the graph of the loss function and before
From the evaluation stage, did you comment with certainty about the performance of the model? Why and if not, what is the solution?
4. Explain at least two methods for data normalization, mentioning the importance of this process, and using one of these methods,
Normalize the data. Did you use the information in the "Evaluation" section in the normalization process? Why?
5 Repeat all parts "1" to "3" using the normalized data and predict the results of the model for five samples.
show data
6. Using Python coding, show the balance of the data in the two classes in the dataset. Do the number of samples
Are the classes equal? What problems can an imbalance in the dataset lead to? What to solve this issue?
What can be done? Implement and compare and report the result.
7. Performed the model training and evaluation process using a ready-made Python classifier and this time in this challenge mode
Resolve class data imbalance.
