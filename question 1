1. Using datasets.sklearn, generate a dataset with 1000 samples, 2 classes and 2 features.
2. By using at least two ready-made Python classes and considering appropriate metaparameters, two classes in the dataset
Separate the previous part. While explaining the selection process of meta-parameters (such as the number of training courses and rates
learning), display the result of training and assessment accuracy. What techniques did you use to improve the result?
3. Show the boundaries and decision areas resulting from your trained model along with examples in a diagram. if you can
Display misclassified samples in a different shape.
4. How can the dataset produced in part "1" be made more challenging and difficult? He did this and
Repeat parts "2" and "3" for this new data and compare the results.
5. If a class is added to the data produced in part "1", in which parts of the teaching and evaluation block diagram
Will there be any changes? Explain about these changes. Can you implement in this mode easily and with
Do you use ready-made Python libraries and code? implement.
